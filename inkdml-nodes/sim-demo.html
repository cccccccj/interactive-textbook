                <p>Below is an example of an embedded simulation written in Loopy. This has nothing to do with Programming Foundations, but it is a demo of the flexibility of the e-textbook format. As with the JSFiddle, the Loopy is contained in an iframe. We are building "wrappers" for commonly used sites so that instructors do not have to know what an iFrame is. They can just "drop in" content with a simple tag (or, soon, via a visual editor!)</p>

                <p>The graphic to the right is an test of the flexibility of the right-hand container. Although it's labelled "video" in the inkdML, it can also be used with images. As with videos, the images will scale to accomodate whatever browser space is available!</p>
