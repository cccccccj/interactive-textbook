                <h2>How am I going to learn JavaScript?</h2>
                
                <p>In this class, we take a challenge-based and passion-driven approach to learning.</p>
                
                <p><b>Challenge-Based:</b> You will learn to code faster and better if you have a goal that goes beyond "pass the class" or "get an A". Think about a challenge like cleaning a messy room: very few people like to do this, even though most people like the result of having a clean room. But what if you've lost your wallet somewhere in the mess, and you're running late for work? Suddenly you have a motivation to do some quick cleaning!</p>
                
                <p>Of course, if you're running late, then you're likely to panic about wasting time and you'll just throw stuff around, maybe even burying your wallet further in the mess! So, while this class has deadlines, they're spread out enough that you shouldn't panic. Every Tuesday or Wednesday, you will have a two-hour lecture/workshop with your primary instructor. Then, every Friday or Saturday, you will have a 90-minute workshop/tutorial with the teaching assistant. This will give you two opportunities every week to make sure that you're heading in the right direction. And if that isn't enough, we also will have a Slack channel for the course, where you can ask your classmates, TAs, and instructors for help!</p>
                    
                <p>Coding requires breaking down problems into small parts and working through them in an organized fashion. Begin each week by looking at the challenge and figuring out what you need to deliver by the following week's deadline. When you do the readings, watch the videos, and play with the demos, ask yourself, "How can I use this in my project?". If you're not sure of the answer to this question, bring it up in class or in a TA session or on Slack.</p>
                
                <p><b>Passion-Driven:</b>You will learn to code faster and better if you're thinking about it in terms of something that applies to your own life. So, starting with this very first week, we ask you to dream up a software application that doesn't yet exist that you would want to use in your daily life.</p>
