                <p>The ten-minute YouTube video in the right column here will explain a bit more about where JavaScript fits in to coding the web.</p>

                <p>Look at the JavaScript at the bottom of this page. Then click the "Result" tab to see what happens when this JavaScript runs. Did it do what you expected?</p>

                <p>Finally, click on the "Edit in JSFiddle" button that's on the far right. This will open an editable copy of the code in a browser tab or window. Experiment with the code! It's just a copy, so you can't mess anything up permanently. In fact, if something goes wrong and you want to start over from the original example again, just return to the browser tab that you're reading right now and click on "Edit in JSFiddle" again. Presto! A clean copy for you to work from!</p>

                <p>TIP: Be sure to sign in to your free JSFiddle account in case you want to save a copy of your code experiment! You should also click on the "Fiddle Meta" area on the right of the JSFiddle interface and change the name of the Fiddle. This way, you'll be able to tell your code apart from the class examples! </p>

                <p>Below is an example of an embedded simulation written in Loopy. This has nothing to do with Programming Foundations, but it is a demo of the flexibility of the e-textbook format. As with the JSFiddle, the Loopy is contained in an iframe. We are building "wrappers" for commonly used sites so that instructors do not have to know what an iFrame is. They can just "drop in" content with a simple tag (or, soon, via a visual editor!)</p>

                <p>The graphic to the right is an test of the flexibility of the right-hand container. Although it's labelled "video" in the inkdML, it can also be used with images. As with videos, the images will scale to accomodate whatever browser space is available!</p>
